# The hash creates a header

md means 'mark down' and is a basic way to format text in this kind of file. 
Yuo can edit the file and then commit it. The full list of commits (updates) are available to see.

#Sub header created in VS code

I had to connect my public key to github so that I can commit to git via VScode. I do this via the bash terminal on VScode.
The git status command show all files that were created, updated or deleted. Untracked files are not being tracked by git.
